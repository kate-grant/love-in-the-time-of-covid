## Back-end Functionality
### This project uses a MERN stack to implement an internal, Restful API. The API handles the date advice data submitted and displayed on the web application, using React components to model, control, and route.

## Front-end Functionality
### This project is composed of 3 pages: Home, About, and Submit. The homepage utilizes the GET API to feature date ideas with the latest at the top. Date ideas are displayed in a customized infinite scroll based on the npm infinite scroll component documentation. The Submit page submission form component utilizes the POST API to allow visitors to contribute to the advice database. A custom navigation bar component uses React Router and Switch to navigate between navigation links.

## Design
### The UX design for Love in the Time of Covid is inspired by the tension between the necessary responsibility to take safety measures during the covid era and the FOMO quarantine has caused. Elizabethan motifs are used to reference the romances of dramatic tragedy, updated for a modern audience.
